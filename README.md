# Digital Assistant
### A digital assistant to interact with Discord and Google Calendar.

This project aims to create an app that interacts with Discord to inform the user when friends want to make plans, make decisions on behalf of the user whether or not to participate in the plans, respond on the user's behalf, and update the user's Google Calendar accordingly.

The app will use the Discord API to interact with Discord, the Google Calendar API to update the user's calendar, and a decision-making algorithm to decide whether or not the user should participate in the plans. This algorithm will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context and meaning of the plans, and machine learning (ML) techniques to learn the user's preferences over time.

### Required APIs:
    Google Calendar API
    Discord API

### For learning about machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP):
